i received this email message below. i think it is related to my google apps script. in the past, i have periodically had to re-connect/re-authorise-re-atheticate my connection. i thought i had found a permanent solution in apps script and the google environment to make this connection permanent, BUT i have received the error message below

step #2 then tell me exactly how to fix this error (presumably within the google environment)

- give me hyper detailed ste-by-step instructions in which you literally tell me exactly what to do to fix this in granular detail: eg: go tho website [x], click on this button [x] from the dropdown click icon x etc. simple plain english with bullet points steps broken down eg: step 1 (heading - task/objctive) step 1a, step 1b step 1c etc then then step 2 (heading/task/objective/) step 2a, step 2b and cotinue



ask me clarifying questions before you start the task, if you are uncertain in respects as to what context is missing or background information
