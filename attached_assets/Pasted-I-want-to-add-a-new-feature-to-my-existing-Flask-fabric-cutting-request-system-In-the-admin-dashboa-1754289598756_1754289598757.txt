I want to add a new feature to my existing Flask fabric cutting request system. In the admin dashboard, next to each record's status dropdown, add a small gold-colored button that says "Email ILIV".
Feature Requirements:
1. Button Appearance

Add a small gold/amber colored button with text "Email ILIV"
Position it next to the existing status dropdown in the actions column
Use an envelope icon if possible (like Font Awesome or similar)
Style it to match the existing UI but make it distinctly gold/amber colored

2. Popup Functionality
When the "Email ILIV" button is clicked:

Show a modal popup with a clean, simple design
The popup should have:

Title: "Send Fabric Request to ILIV"
A text area pre-filled with the email content (editable)
"Send Email" button (primary color)
"Cancel" button (secondary color)
X close button in top right



3. Email Template
Pre-fill the email with this exact format:
Subject: [ATT: Juris] - Cuttings Request - Slender Morris
Body:
Hi Juris

Please send us the following cuttings:
- [Pull fabric names from the fabric_selections JSON field for this record]
  For example, if fabric_selections contains ["Incanto Rosa", "Savoy blush", "parker blush", "parker rose", "parker candy"], list each as a bullet point

Please send the order confirmation to: ORDERS@SLENDERMORRIS.COM (NOT this email address)

Thanks
Matthew & Neville - Slender Morris
4. Email Recipients
Always send to these 4 email addresses:

orders@slendermorris.com
slendermorris@gmail.com
export@iliv.co.uk
jurijs_peremots@smd-textiles.co.uk

5. Technical Implementation

Add a new route /admin/email_iliv/<int:request_id> that handles the email sending
Create a new function in email_service.py called send_iliv_fabric_request
Use the existing SMTP configuration from environment variables
Parse the fabric_selections JSON field to extract the fabric names
Show a success message after sending: "Email sent successfully to ILIV"
Show error message if email fails: "Failed to send email. Please try again."

6. JavaScript/Frontend

Add JavaScript to handle the popup modal
Make the email text editable in the textarea before sending
Use AJAX to send the email without page reload
Show loading spinner while sending

7. Update Admin Template
In the admin dashboard template where the actions are displayed:

Add the new "Email ILIV" button for each row
Ensure it passes the correct request_id to the email function
Only show the button for records that have fabric_selections

Please implement this feature maintaining the existing security and error handling patterns in the codebase. The email functionality should follow the same patterns as the existing send_confirmation_email and send_dispatch_notification functions.
