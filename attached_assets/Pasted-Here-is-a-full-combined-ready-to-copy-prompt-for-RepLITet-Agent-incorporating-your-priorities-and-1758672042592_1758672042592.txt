Here is a full, combined, ready-to-copy prompt for RepLITet Agent, incorporating your priorities and all professional-grade safeguards:

Mission-Critical Data Integrity & Workflow Requirements

Please bring in the architect to provide documentation and create a workflow where:

The app and all agents must never run on memory, SQLite, or any form of local or in-memory storage for business operations.

All new visits, updates, requests, and business records must always be sent directly to—and only persisted in—the Neon PostgreSQL production database via the configured DATABASE_URL secret.

The production database must never be able to be deleted, reset, or overwritten—no destructive actions without explicit, manually approved backup and human confirmation.

There must be up-to-date documentation and workflow instructions included in the repository and agent system for:

Normal (“healthy”) live operation mode — always using the database;

Recovery and disaster handling — the step-by-step method for identifying, reconnecting, and restoring historical data if disconnected or damaged;

Escalation and human/manual steps if database or restore tools aren't available.

Comprehensive Safeguards You Must Enforce:

No memory/local fallback:

All operations (creating, reading, updating, deleting records) must always use the Neon/PostgreSQL production database connection.

If the connection fails, app must alert admins—never switch to memory/SQLite/temporary local storage.

NEVER allow data deletion/reset:

The live business database must not be deleted or dropped for any reason. All schema migrations, tests, and demo data must run only on a separate, isolated development environment.

Backups required:

Before any code or workflow change affecting the database, always generate a fresh full backup (CSV, JSON, SQL dump, or Neon branch backup). Save and log its location.

Automated and auditable restores:

If restore required (e.g., after corruption, endpoint disablement), use Neon point-in-time recovery or snapshot/branch restore first.

Always log the restore date/time, who/what restored, and keep a human-auditable record.

Agent/architect workflow documentation:

Maintain step-by-step, up-to-date recovery and connection instructions in project documentation and system logs. This must include clear instructions for agents and humans should any similar issue happen again.

Integrity and business data checks:

After every restore or backup, run checks to:

Verify expected number of business records, customer names, and no fake/test data.

Report and block workflow if authentic business data is missing.

Explicit separation of environments:

Never run tests, restores, or development scripts on production—the only database used for business operations is the designated Neon prod database, as per the current DATABASE_URL secret.

Manual confirmation for risky changes:

No agent, script, or automation is allowed to perform a destructive, resetting, or seeding operation on production data without explicit, real-time human (not agent) approval.

Never repeat this process:

RepLITet must use the above workflow every time, so this recovery process never has to be improvised again: always connect to the database, never store data in memory, always have recovery/backup plan, always check integrity, and always keep documentation current.

Summary:
Your #1 priority: Business data must always be database-backed, never at risk of loss through memory fallback or accidental deletion. All workflows, code, and documentation must enforce this—forever.

Copy and paste this to any RepLITet agent as permanent instructions for bulletproof data reliability.
